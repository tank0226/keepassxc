== Interface Overview
=== Application Layout
The KeePassXC interface is designed for simplicity and easy access to your information. The main database view is split into three main partitions detailed below. You can open multiple databases at the same time, they will appear in tabs.

.Main database interface

*(A) Groups* - Organize your entries into discrete groups to bring order to all of your sensitive information. Groups can be nested under each other to create a hierarchy. Settings from parent groups get applied to their children. You can hide this panel on the View menu.

*(B) Entries* - Entries contain all the information for each website or application you are storing in KeePassXC. This view shows all the entries in the selected group. Each column can be resized, reordered, and shown or hidden based on your preference. Right click the header row to see all available options.

*\(C) Preview* - Shows a preview of the selected group or entry. You can temporarily hide this preview using the close button on the right hand side or completely disabled in the application settings.

TIP: Double clicking on the text in the entries list copies that field to the clipboard. Double clicking the entry title will open the entry for editing.

=== Toolbar
The toolbar provides a quick way to perform common tasks with your database. Some entries in the toolbar are dynamically disabled based on the information contained in the selected entry. Every common action in KeePassXC can be controlled with a keyboard shortcut as well.

.Toolbar overview

=== Application Settings
Users can configure KeePassXC to their personal tastes with a wide variety of general and security settings that apply to the whole application. These settings are accessible from _Tools_ -> _Settings_ or the cog wheel icon from the toolbar. Settings include: startup options, file management, entry management, user interface, language, security timeouts, and convenience.

==== Setting the Theme
KeePassXC ships with light and dark themes specifically designed to meet accessibility standards. In most cases, the appropriate theme for your system will be determined automatically, but you can always set a specific theme by using the _View_ menu. When a new theme is selected you will be prompted to restart KeePassXC to apply the theme immediately.

==== Compact Mode
For users with smaller screens or those who desire seeing more entries at once, KeePassXC offers a compact view mode. This mode shows smaller toolbar, group, and entry icons. The effect of compact mode (left side) can be seen below.

==== Copy entry Columns on Double Click
KeePassXC offers the possibility of copying certain entry columns, such as username and password, into your clipboard on double click, for a limited period of time.

This feature can be enabled by checking the box "Enable double click to copy some entry columns" in the security settings:
